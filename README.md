# MElib
A library that allows you to easily offload tasks to the PSP Media Engine

This library is currently under development, but allows for ease of use when it comes to integrating into new PSP projects!
This library is intended to allow users to custom define code with a Job Manager for both CPU and ME execution.

## How to use the Media Engine Library

Currently it reflects the Daedalus Driver only *this will change soon* but will be changing soon. More features will be added allowing easier use of the Media Engine. To use it, make sure the `mediaengine.prx` file is in your directory with the `EBOOT.PBP`. Next, add the includes and libraries to your project. Finally, make sure you link with `-lme`

Currently there is no documentation, but there will be documentation for the full job manager system.
